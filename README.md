# request-editor

An element that renders the UI to create a HTTP request.

It produces the following values (as element's properties):
- url - the request URL
- method - HTTP method
- headers - HTTP headers string
- payload - Request body. It can be either [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) ([Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/Blob)) or [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData).

## Variables

Output of abt of this properties can contain a variables in format `${varName}`.
Use [variables-evaluator](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/variables-evaluator)
to evaluate variables to the final output.

This element works with [variables-manager](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/variables-manager)
that stores variables in the local datastore. It should be placed anywhere in the DOM. The elements
uses browser's events system to communicate.

## Events retargeting

The editors listens to varous events related to the request state. By default
all of the editors listens on a window object. To limit this, set `eventsTarget`
on this element to point an element that will be used as events target.
This way it is possible to enclose the request panel in a "tab".

The `eventsTarget` property is propagated to the editors.

Event fired by this or any of the editors will not stop on the `eventsTarget`
element and you are responsible to cancel them if nescesary.

## Accessing request data

You can access request data by either accessing corresponding property of the
element, by listening for `property-changed` event or by listening for
`request-data-changed` custom event.
Only the last one bubbles through the DOM.

### Example
```
<request-editor url="{{requestUrl}}" on-headers-changed="_headersChangedEvent"></request-editor>
```
or
```
document.body.addEventListener('request-data-changed', e => {
  console.log(e.detail);
});
```

### Styling
`<request-editor>` provides the following custom properties and mixins for styling:

- [headers-editor](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/headers-editor)
- [http-method-selector](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/http-method-selector)
- [payload-editor](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/payload-editor)

Also paper elements: `paper-button`, `paper-tab`, `paper-tabs`, `paper-tooltip`
